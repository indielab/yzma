## Using the `yzma` command to install `llama.cpp`

You can use the `yzma install` command to download the llama.cpp pre-built binaries for the current operating system.

```
NAME:
   yzma install - Install llama.cpp libraries used by yzma

USAGE:
   yzma install [command options]

OPTIONS:
   --version value, -v value    version of llama.cpp to install, optionally as VERSION@sha256:DIGEST to pin the digests (leave empty for the version this yzma release uses)
   --lib value, -l value        path to llama.cpp compiled library files [$YZMA_LIB]
   --processor value, -p value  processor to use (cpu, cuda, metal, vulkan) (default: "cpu")
   --upgrade, -u                upgrade existing installation (default: false)
   --quiet, -q                  suppress output during installation (default: false)
   --verify value               how to check the digest of each download (available, require, off) (default: "available") [$YZMA_VERIFY]
   --help, -h                   show help
```

Here are a few examples:

```
# Install with default settings (uses YZMA_LIB env var)
yzma install

# Install to specific path
yzma install --lib /path/to/lib

# Install specific version with CUDA
yzma install --lib /path/to/lib --version b1234 --processor cuda

# Upgrade existing installation
yzma install --lib /path/to/lib --upgrade

# Using short flags
yzma install -l /path/to/lib -v b1234 -p cuda -u

# Install a version and pin the digests it must have
yzma install --lib /path/to/lib --version b1234@sha256:<digest>
```

A version with no digest keeps working exactly as before, so `--version b1234` and a
bare `yzma install` need nothing new.

The digest to pin is the SHA-256 of the digest manifest of the release, which
`llama-cpp-builder` publishes with the release. The release notes for the tag print the
complete pin, and the version file carries it for the newest build:

```console
$ curl -s https://hybridgroup.github.io/llama-cpp-builder/version.json
{"tag_name":"b10816","manifest_sha256":"<digest>","pin":"b10816@sha256:<digest>"}

$ yzma install --lib /path/to/lib --version b10816@sha256:<digest>
```

The digest of a platform archive is not this value. Those digests are what the manifest
holds, one for each asset. See [Verify an installation](https://yzma.ai/docs/guides/verifying/)
for the whole chain.

## Other commands

See the `yzma help` command for more information about the other things you can do with the `yzma` CLI tool.

## `yzma-checker`

The `yzma-checker` directory holds a separate developer tool, not a subcommand of the `yzma` CLI. It compares the FFI parameter and return types of each yzma binding, and the values of the constants yzma mirrors, with the llama.cpp headers. It is a nested Go module, so `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` at the repo root do not include it.

```shell
make check-ffi
```

See [yzma-checker/README.md](./yzma-checker/README.md) for what it verifies and how.

## Using the `yzma` command to check an installation

`yzma install` checks the digest of each archive as it downloads it, but the archive is
removed as soon as it is extracted. The `yzma verify` command checks the files that are
in place, against the digests that the publisher recorded for the release.

```
NAME:
   yzma verify - Check the installed llama.cpp libraries against their published digests

USAGE:
   yzma verify [command options]

OPTIONS:
   --lib value, -l value      path to llama.cpp compiled library files [$YZMA_LIB]
   --version value, -v value  the llama.cpp version that must be installed, optionally as VERSION@sha256:DIGEST to pin the digests (leave empty to take the installed one)
   --strict                   also fail when a file in the directory is not part of the install (default: false)
   --json                     write the report as JSON (default: false)
   --help, -h                 show help
```

```
$ yzma verify --lib /path/to/lib
llama.cpp b10783 in /path/to/lib
68 verified, 0 changed, 0 missing, 0 not part of this install
ok.
```

A file that was changed or removed makes the command exit with a status of 1:

```
$ yzma verify --lib /path/to/lib
llama.cpp b10783 in /path/to/lib
  changed    libllama.so.0.3.0
  missing    libggml-base.so.0.22.0
66 verified, 1 changed, 1 missing, 0 not part of this install
```

Notes:

- `yzma install` writes `yzma-install.json` beside the libraries to say what it put
  there. `yzma verify` needs it, so an installation made by an older yzma has to be
  installed again first.
- `yzma install` also writes `yzma-manifest.json`, which holds the digests of the
  release, so `yzma verify` needs no network. An installation that has no manifest beside
  it makes the command fetch one and keep it, so only the first check needs a network.
- The record is beside the libraries, so anything that can change the libraries can
  change the record. Give `--version` to say which release must be there. The check then
  resolves the assets of that release itself and does not read the tag from the record.
- A directory can hold more than one install, so a file that is not part of this one is
  reported but does not fail the check. Add `--strict` to fail on those too.
- Only the assets that `llama-cpp-builder` builds carry digests for the files in them.
  An install that came from the `llama.cpp` release page has an archive digest but no
  file digests, so `yzma verify` says so instead of passing.
- `--version` also takes `VERSION@sha256:<digest>`, where the digest is the SHA-256 of
  the digest manifest of the release. The expected value then comes from where you keep
  it, and not from the site that serves the manifest. A pin makes the check mandatory,
  so it does not go with `--verify off`. See [Verify an installation](https://yzma.ai/docs/guides/verifying/)
  for what a pin does and does not show.
